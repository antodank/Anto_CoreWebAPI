Client-server architecture: The complete service is comprised of the “Client” which is the front end and the “Server” which is the backend part of the whole system

Stateless: All REST interactions are stateless. That is, each request contains all of the information necessary for a connector to understand the request and 
independent of any requests

Cacheable: The client should be able to store responses in a cache for the greater performance

Versioning


the LoggerService project, add npm -
NLog.Extensions.Logging 


By calling services.AddSingleton will create the service the first time you request it and then every subsequent request is calling the same instance of the service.
This means that all components are sharing the same service every time they need it. You are using the same instance always

By calling services.AddScoped will create the service once per request. That means whenever we send the HTTP request towards the application, 
a new instance of the service is created

By calling services.AddTransient will create the service each time the application request it. This means that if during one request towards our application, 
multiple components need the service, this service will be created again for every single component which needs it
